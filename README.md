#Target Function


## Description
This repository provides an example code snippet for testing a target function using libAFL. The target function takes a byte slice as input, converts it to a UTF-8 string, converts the resulting string to uppercase, and then prints the original input and the uppercase result.

## Usage
Follow the steps below to test the target function using libAFL:

Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
  ```

Change to the repository directory:
```shell
cd repository
  ```

Build the project:
```shell
cargo build --release
  ```    

Prepare the input file for libAFL:

Create an input file with the desired input for testing. For example, you can create a file called input.txt and add the input hello, world to it.

Run the target function using libAFL:
```shell
libafl-fuzz -i input.txt -o findings target/release/repository
  ```
Replace input.txt with the path to your input file and target/release/repository with the path to the compiled target binary.

Monitor the fuzzing process:

libAFL will start fuzzing the target function with different inputs, including the ones in your input file. Monitor the process and check the findings directory for any discovered issues.

## Additional Notes

* The provided code snippet is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. Adjustments may be required based on your specific use case.
* Ensure that libAFL is correctly installed and configured prior to running the fuzzing process. Consult the libAFL documentation for installation instructions and further information
